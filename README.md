# typescript-playwright-tests

Automated end-to-end (E2E) and UI testing using Playwright with TypeScript.
Includes real-world test cases like TodoMVC and OrangeHRM login, structured with best practices: Page Object Model, reporting, screenshots, and trace handling.

---

## Features

* TypeScript for strong typing and cleaner code
* Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) via Playwright
* Page Object Model (POM) for modular test structure
* Functional and visual test examples (Applitools optional)
* Screenshots and trace capture for each test
* Built-in HTML report generation
* Headed/fullscreen browser test option
* `.env` support for API keys and credentials

---

## Project Structure

```
├── tests/                 # Test specs
├── pages/                 # Page Object Models
├── utils/                 # Helpers and utilities
├── playwright.config.ts   # Playwright configuration
├── report/                # HTML test reports
└── .env                   # Environment variables (optional)
```

---

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. (Optional) Create a `.env` file for secrets (API keys, credentials)

---

## Running Tests

* Run all tests in all browsers:

  ```bash
  npx playwright test
  ```

* Run a specific test file:

  ```bash
  npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts
  ```

* Run in headed mode (UI visible):

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --headed
  ```

* Show HTML test report:

  ```bash
  npx playwright show-report
  ```

---

## Screenshots & Traces

* Screenshots are taken for all tests (pass/fail)
* Traces are saved for failed tests
* Open the HTML report to view them

---

## Page Object Model

All UI elements and interactions are encapsulated in separate classes under the `pages/` folder for better maintainability and reusability.

---

## Debugging

* Debug mode:

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --debug
  ```

* Interactive UI mode:

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --ui
  ```

---

## .gitignore

Recommended `.gitignore` entries:

```

.env
```
